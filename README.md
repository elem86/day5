🎯 Day 5 – One Project a Day Until I Get Hired

🧩 Excel Chart Race – Part 2: Automation with VBA

Today I tackled the automation side of the animated Olympic medal chart race using VBA!

✅ What I accomplished:

  - 🧮 Implemented a macro that auto-scrolls through Olympic years using a Start button

  - 🛑 Added a Reset button to jump back to the beginning

  - 📊 Chart now animates relatively smoothly as countries accumulate medals year by year

 - ⏱ Fine-tuned timing and responsiveness using DoEvents and public module variables

📈 The most satisfying part? Watching the top 20 countries dynamically rise and fall as the timeline progresses — it really brings the data to life.

🎥 I’ve recorded the full animation and posted the updated files.

🕒 Given the 1–2 hour daily time limit I set for these projects, polishing the design and visual details is currently out of scope — but the core functionality is there and working!
